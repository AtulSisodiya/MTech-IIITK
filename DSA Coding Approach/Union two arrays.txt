Solution 1: Using Map
Our aim is to find the common elements in arr1 and arr2, and the distinct elements of arr1,arr2. Use a Single map to find the frequencies of elements in arr1 and arr2.

As we are using only a single map the common element in arr1 and arr2 are treated as a single element for finding frequency, so there would be no duplicates.

Why not unordered_map?
In unordered_map the keys are stored in random order, while in the map the keys are stored in sorted order (ascending order by default). As we require elements of the union to be in ascending order, using a map is preferable.

We can also use unordered_map, but after finding the union of arr1 and arr2, we need to sort the union vector to get the elements of the union in sorted order.


#include <bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;

vector < int > FindUnion(int arr1[], int arr2[], int n, int m) {
  map < int, int > freq;
  vector < int > Union;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    freq[arr1[i]]++;
  for (int i = 0; i < m; i++)
    freq[arr2[i]]++;
  for (auto & it: freq)
    Union.push_back(it.first);
  return Union;
}

int main() {
  int n = 10, m = 7;
  int arr1[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10};
  int arr2[] = {2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 11, 12};
  vector < int > Union = FindUnion(arr1, arr2, n, m);
  cout << "Union of arr1 and arr2 is " << endl;
  for (auto & val: Union)
    cout << val << " ";
  return 0;
}



Solution 2: Using Set
Suppose we consider arr1 and arr2 as a single array say arr,  then the union of arr1 and arr2 is the distinct elements in arr.

Example:
arr1[] = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}
arr2[] = {2,3,4,4,5,11,12} 
arr = arr1 + arr2 = {1,2,3,4,5,67,8,9,
                     10,2,3,4,4,5,11,12}

Distinct element in 
arr = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12} 
    = Union of arr1 ,arr2.
So using a set we can find the distinct elements because the set does not hold any duplicates. Hence we can find the union of arr1 and arr2.

Why not unordered_set?
In unordered_set the elements are stored in random order, while in a set the keys are stored in sorted order (ascending order by default). As we require elements of the union to be in ascending order, using a set is preferable.

We can also use unordered_set, but after finding the union of arr1 and arr2, we need to sort the union vector to get the elements of the union in sorted order.

  set < int > s;
  vector < int > Union;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    s.insert(arr1[i]);
  for (int i = 0; i < m; i++)
    s.insert(arr2[i]);
  for (auto & it: s)
    Union.push_back(it);
  return Union;
}

int main()

{
  int n = 10, m = 7;
  int arr1[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10};
  int arr2[] = {2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 11, 12};
  vector < int > Union = FindUnion(arr1, arr2, n, m);
  cout << "Union of arr1 and arr2 is  " << endl;
  for (auto & val: Union)
    cout << val << " ";
  return 0;
}


Solution 3: Two Pointers
Solution 1 and 2 work for the unsorted arrays also, The arrays arr1 and arr2 are sorted, can we use this property to reduce the time Complexity?

Using the property that the arrays are sorted we can bring down the time complexity from

O((m+n)log(m+n))    TO    O(m+n).
Approach:
Take two pointers let’s say i,j pointing to the 0th index of arr1 and arr2.
Create an empty vector for storing the union of arr1 and arr2.
From solution 2 we know that the union is nothing but the distinct elements in arr1 + arr2 
Let’s traverse the arr1 and arr2 using pointers i and j and insert the distinct elements found into the union vector.
While traversing we may encounter three cases.

arr1[ i ] == arr2[ j ] 
Here we found a common element, so insert only one element in the union. Let’s insert arr[i] in union and increment i.

NOTE: There may be cases like the element to be inserted is already present in the union, in that case, we are inserting duplicates which is not desired. So while inserting always check whether the last element in the union vector is equal or not to the element to be inserted. If equal we are trying to insert duplicates, so don’t insert the element, else insert the element in the union. This makes sure that we are not inserting any duplicates in the union because we are inserting elements in sorted order.
arr1[ i ]  < arr2[ j ]
arr1[ i ] < arr2[ j ] so we need to insert arr1[ i ] in union.IF last element in  union vector is not equal to arr1[ i ],then insert in union else don’t insert. After checking Increment i.
arr1[ i ] > arr2[ j ]
arr1[ i ] > arr2[ j ] so we need to insert arr2[ j ] in union. IF the last element in the union vector is not equal to arr2[ j ], then insert in the union, else don’t insert. After checking Increment j. After traversing if any elements are left in arr1 or arr2 check for condition and insert in the union.




#include <bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;

vector < int > FindUnion(int arr1[], int arr2[], int n, int m) {
  int i = 0, j = 0; // pointers
  vector < int > Union; // Uninon vector
  while (i < n && j < m) {
    if (arr1[i] <= arr2[j]) // Case 1 and 2
    {
      if (Union.size() == 0 || Union.back() != arr1[i])
        Union.push_back(arr1[i]);
      i++;
    } else // case 3
    {
      if (Union.size() == 0 || Union.back() != arr2[j])
        Union.push_back(arr2[j]);
      j++;
    }
  }
  while (i < n) // IF any element left in arr1
  {
    if (Union.back() != arr1[i])
      Union.push_back(arr1[i]);
    i++;
  }
  while (j < m) // If any elements left in arr2
  {
    if (Union.back() != arr2[j])
      Union.push_back(arr2[j]);
    j++;
  }
  return Union;
