Count Maximum Consecutive One's in the array

Problem Statement: Given an array that contains only 1 and 0 return the count of maximum consecutive ones in the array.

Examples:

Example 1:

Input: prices = {1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1}

Output: 3

Explanation: There are two consecutive 1’s and three consecutive 1’s in the array out of which maximum is 3.

Input: prices = {1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1} 

Output: 2

Explanation: There are two consecutive 1's in the array. 
Solution:

Disclaimer: Don't jump directly to the solution, try it out yourself first.

Approach:  We maintain a variable count that keeps a track of the number of consecutive 1’s while traversing the array. The other variable max_count maintains the maximum number of 1’s, in other words, it maintains the answer.

We start traversing from the beginning of the array. Since we can encounter either a 1 or 0 there can be two situations:-

If  the value at the current index is equal to 1 we increase the value of count by one. After updating  the count variable if it becomes more than the max_count  update the max_count.
If the value at the current index is equal to zero we make the variable count as 0 since there are no more consecutive ones.
 See the illustration below for a better understanding



Code:

C++
Java
Python
#include <bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;
class Solution {
  public:
    int findMaxConsecutiveOnes(vector < int > & nums) {
      int cnt = 0;
      int maxi = 0;
      for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
        if (nums[i] == 1) {
          cnt++;
        } else {
          cnt = 0;
        }

        maxi = max(maxi, cnt);
      }
      return maxi;
    }
};

int main() {
  vector < int > nums = { 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1 };
  Solution obj;
  int ans = obj.findMaxConsecutiveOnes(nums);
  cout << "The maximum  consecutive 1's are " << ans;
  return 0;
}
Output: The maximum consecutive 1’s are 3.

Time Complexity: O(N) since the solution involves only a single pass.

Space Complexity: O(1) because no extra space is used.
